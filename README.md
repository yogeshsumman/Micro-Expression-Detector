MicroSense: The Micro-Expression Detector
Introduction
MicroSense is a deep learning-based tool designed to detect micro-expressions in video uploads. Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions, making this project valuable for applications in psychology, security, and human-computer interaction.

Features
‚úÖ Detects micro-expressions in uploaded videos
‚úÖ Built using the YOLO object detection algorithm
‚úÖ Trained on 10,000+ examples and 10+ different micro-expressions
‚úÖ High accuracy in detecting subtle facial expressions
‚úÖ User-friendly interface for video upload and analysis
